# Homebridge Simple WLED

Homebridge Plugin for WLED Strip ([WLED-Project by Aircoookie](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED))

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation / NPM Package
For downloading and installing the Plugin NPM is used in Homebridge: [Link to NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-simple-wled)

## üî® Adding the Accessory to the config.json
To make the accessory visible in your HomeKIT App you have to add the Platform-Accessory to the config.json to the platforms section:

```
    "platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "WLED",
            "wleds": [
                {
                    "name": "LED-Tisch",
                    "host": "10.0.0.52",
                    "presets": [1,2,3],
                    "log": true
                },
                {
                    "name": "LED-Kasten",
                    "host": ["10.0.0.53", "10.0.0.54"],
                    "presets": [1,2,3],
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

After editing the config, restart your HomeBridge Server and add the accessory manually from the Home App.
If you encounter some issues when adding the accessory to the homekit app, open an issue in GitHub...

## üí° Configure own Effect-Switch
To use your own effects you have an option "effects" you can add to your config.json and add as value a comma-seperated list of supported effects of your choice.
All effects are found under [Effects-List - WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/List-of-effects-and-palettes)
(Just use Names from the Effects and not from the palettes!!)

sample additional option:

```
    "platforms": [
                {
            "platform": "WLED",
            "wleds": [
                {
                    "name": "LED-Tisch",
                    "host": "10.0.0.52",
                    "effects": ["Rainbow Runner", "Circus", "Merry Christmas", "Fireworks"],
                    "log": false
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

If you want to turn off the WLED when turning off the WLED-Effect-Switch then you can add the option "turnOffWledWithEffect", (default: false)


```
    "platforms": [
                {
            "platform": "WLED",
            "wleds": [
                {
                    "name": "LED-Tisch",
                    "host": "10.0.0.52",
                    "effects": ["Rainbow Runner", "Circus", "Merry Christmas", "Fireworks"],
                    "turnOffWledWithEffect": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

If you want to disable the Effect-Switch to just use the normal "LightBulb" function. You can just remove the "effects" option in the config.json.

### üõ† Configure Effect speed

To configure the speed of your effects, you can define a standard Speed in your config.json:

"defaultEffectSpeed": <NUMBER FROM 1-255> (Standard is 15) (optional)

```
"platforms": [
                {
            "platform": "WLED",
            "wleds": [
                {
                    "name": "LED-Tisch",
                    "host": "10.0.0.52",
                    "effects": ["Rainbow Runner", "Circus", "Merry Christmas", "Fireworks"],
                    "log": false,
                    "defaultEffectSpeed": 20
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

or you can add a Effect Speed Control Element (Lightbulb accessory which controls the Effect speed)

"showEffectControl": <BOOLEAN> (Standard is false) (optional)

```
"platforms": [
                {
            "platform": "WLED",
            "wleds": [
                {
                    "name": "LED-Tisch",
                    "host": "10.0.0.52",
                    "effects": ["Rainbow Runner", "Circus", "Merry Christmas", "Fireworks"],
                    "log": false,
                    "showEffectControl": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

## üí°üí°üí° Adding multiple WLED-hosts to a single accessory
If you want to control multiple WLED-hosts with a single accessory, you have to set the "host" option to a list/array as below:
Note: The first WLED-host will act like a main-WLED, so for example, you change the color of the first WLED (10.0.0.52) via the WEB-Panel of the WLED it also changes for the following WLEDS (10.0.0.53, 10.0.0.54,...).

```
    "platforms": [
                {
            "platform": "WLED",
            "wleds": [
                {
                    "name": "LED-Tisch",
                    "host": ["10.0.0.52", "10.0.0.53", "10.0.0.54"],
                    "effects": ["Rainbow Runner", "Circus", "Merry Christmas", "Fireworks"],
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```
